# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

As the chances of having a heart disease is increasing because of the unhealthy life style we are living. There can be multiple reasons of having heart disease.
It will be much better to know it before having any heart disease. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. 
This project predicts whether any person have a heart disease based on the data.


The dataset consist of the data of previous patients who have or do not have heart disease. 
Project starts with analysis of the Heart disease data-set followed by some visualization. Then some models were trained and predictions were made. The accuracy score was calculated for every model and then some adjustments were made on the models and final accuracy of  90% is achieved.
